            Choosing where to start a business is always a difficult decision. Rather than relying on 
            evidence-based strategies, entrepreneurs often make decisions based on intuition or 
            outdated heuristics, which can lead to significant resource misallocation. A predictive 
            algorithm that estimates item-level gross profit can support data-driven decision making 
            and help entrepreneurs develop successful business strategies. As a first step, we 
            develop an algorithm to project item-level gross profits in liquor stores, using Iowa 
            liquor sales data.          

            **Research Question**
            - How can we leverage demographic, economic, and liquor sales data to develop a 
            predictive algorithm that helps liquor store owners identify optimal store locations and 
            product assortments?
            - Which geographic or socioeconomic groups are most associated with higher alcohol 
            consumption or preferences for specific types of liquor?

            **How to Use**
            - **Business Perspective.** The algorithm identifies which products sell best in 
            different types of areas (e.g., high-income cities may prefer Item B). This enables liquor 
            owners to tailor product assortments based on local demographics to maximize sales and 
            reduce inventory risk.
            - **Policy Perspective.** The model can help policymakers identify areas with high 
            predicted alcohol consumption, allowing for targeted interventions to mitigate public 
            health risks. It may also help local governments optimize alcohol-related tax revenues.

            - [Store Types](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data): Categories of class "E" liquor selling stores such as: grocery store, liquor store/bar, gas station, pharmacy, distillery/brewery, general store, convenience store, other, or unknown.
            - [Liquor Types](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data): Categories of liquor types such as whiskey liqueur, canadian whisky, aged rum, ect.
            
            **Data Sourcing** 
            - Iowa Liquor Sales: Contains transaciton level records of stores licensed to sell liquor to be consumed off-premise. It includes product details, store name/location, quantities sold, and sale prices.
            - U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS 5-Year Estimates): This program aggregates demographic, social, economic, and housing data at a county level. It pools rolling 5-year periods to provide a larger sample size that is more reliable for small population areas.
            - County Health Rankings: Jointly run by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, this initiative produces annual rankings of U.S. counties based on health outcomes.

st.markdown('''
            - **Observational data only.** We cannot infer causal relationships, this model is predictive.
            - **Limited external validity.** A model trained on Iowa may not generalize to other states, especially non-Midwestern ones.
            - **Complex interpretation.** Using many features makes it hard to pinpoint individual drivers, particularly after regularization.
            - **Scope of sales data.** We only have liquor transaction data‚Äîno beer, wine, or cider.
            - **Missing ancillary purchases.** There‚Äôs no data on complementary food or non‚Äëliquor drinks, which could affect item‚Äëlevel profit.
