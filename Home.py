            **Research Question**
            - What kind of algorithm should we develop to help liquor owners decide on
            the location of a liquor store and assortment of liquors?

            **How to Use**
            - The model shows which products sell best in different types of cities (e.g., high-income areas prefer Item B). Thus, managers can tailor the product lineup for each store based on local demographics to maximize sales.
            - The model identifies peak months for each product (e.g., Item A peaks in December, Item C in June), so managers can schedule promotions and adjust inventory levels accordingly to capture seasonal demand.
