            Choosing where to start a business is always a difficult decision. Rather than relying on 
            evidence-based strategies, entrepreneurs often make decisions based on intuition or 
            outdated heuristics, which can lead to significant resource misallocation. A predictive 
            algorithm that estimates item-level gross profit can support data-driven decision making 
            and help entrepreneurs develop successful business strategies. As a first step, we 
            develop an algorithm to project item-level gross profits in liquor stores, using Iowa 
            liquor sales data.          

            **Research Question**
            - How can we leverage demographic, economic, and liquor sales data to develop a 
            predictive algorithm that helps liquor store owners identify optimal store locations and 
            product assortments?
            - Which geographic or socioeconomic groups are most associated with higher alcohol 
            consumption or preferences for specific types of liquor?

            **How to Use**
            - **Business Perspective.** The algorithm identifies which products sell best in 
            different types of areas (e.g., high-income cities may prefer Item B). This enables liquor 
            owners to tailor product assortments based on local demographics to maximize sales and 
            reduce inventory risk.
            - **Policy Perspective.** The model can help policymakers identify areas with high 
            predicted alcohol consumption, allowing for targeted interventions to mitigate public 
            health risks. It may also help local governments optimize alcohol-related tax revenues.
