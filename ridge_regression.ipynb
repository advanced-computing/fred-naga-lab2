That is when all types of merchants go to the markets in search of potential customers, most of whom are farmers.  Tourism is also an important activity for this canton because of its natural ecosystem, with a variety of attractions, such as water falls, sweet water rivers, forests, and the flora and fauna that adorn the city.\\n\\nFour years ago, Stephany learned from a friend how to sell cosmetics by catalogue, working as a street vendor.  Despite having divorced her husband, she has sought out ways to care for her son, while also working hard to support him.  With experience, she has learned how to manage her income correctly; and now that her son is growing, it is easier for her to go out to offer her products to customers.  Every day she takes advantage of the opportunities and needs of her customers, most of whom are women.  She feels ready to take the next step which is to set up business in one location.

This client is a perfect example of why microfinance works and why the overwhelming majority of clients repay their loans. Many people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, “How do you make sure people pay back? Won’t they just take the money?”  Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is the incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another… The incentive to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded is a powerful one.', 'status': '', 'funded_amount': '425', 'paid_amount': '', 'terms_disbursal_amount': '500000.0', 'loan_amount': '425', 'activity': 'Cereals', 'sector': 'Food', 'location_country': 'Tanzania', 'location_town': 'Mbeya', 'repayment_term': '12'}, {'': '13575', 'borrowers_borrower_gender': 'F', 'description_texts_en': \"Maria is a 38-year-old married woman.
